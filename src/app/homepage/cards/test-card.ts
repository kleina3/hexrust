    "<p>The world of Hexrust Mesa is gritty in almost every sense of the term. The possibility of death hangs over every adventuring party, and players will often be faced with situations where there is no ideal solution. Victory will not be handed to you; it must be earned.</p><p>On the other hand, the opportunity for heroism is plentiful. The world is rife with evils that actively terrorize the common folk. Player characters will usually be seeking to enact positive change, not just prevent negative ones.</p>"
